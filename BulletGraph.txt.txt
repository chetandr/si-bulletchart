1. Work Packet : Bullet Graphs
The bullet graph was developed to replace the meters and gauges that are often used on 
dashboards. Its linear and no-frills design provides a rich display of data in a small space, which 
is essential on a dashboard. Like most meters and gauges, bullet graphs feature a single 
quantitative measure (for example, year-to-date revenue) along with complementary measures 
to enrich the meaning of the featured measure. Specifically, bullet graphs support the 
comparison of the featured measure to one or more related measures (for example, a target or 
the same measure at some point in the past, such as a year ago) and relate the featured 
measure to defined quantitative ranges that declare its qualitative state (for example, good, 
satisfactory, and poor). Its linear design not only gives it a small footprint, but also supports 
more efficient reading than radial meters.
